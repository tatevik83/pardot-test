# pardot-test

Test project that uses CHROME WebDriver plugin to test pardot for the following use case:

Log in to Pardot (https://pi.pardot.com, Username: pardot.applicant@pardot.com, Password: Applicant2012)
Create a list with a random name (Marketing > Segmentation > Lists)
Attempt to create another list with that same name and ensure the system correctly gives a validation failure
Rename the original list
Ensure the system allows the creation of another list with the original name now that the original list is renamed
Create a new prospect (Prospect > Prospect List)
Add your new prospect to the newly created list
Ensure the new prospect is successfully added to the list upon save
Send a text only email to the list (Marketing > Emails)  *Please note, email is disabled in this account so you will not actually be able to send the email.  This is okay.
